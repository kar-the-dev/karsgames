<h1>Theres no escape... Read forever and ever...</h1>
<p>Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.

Corner? There was no corner
So I sat in the middle of the floor
Surrounded by rats.

Rat? I can't stand rats.
They tickled my feet.
They made me laugh.
I laughed so hard I thought I would die

Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.

Worms? I hate worms.
They burrowed into my skull And started to eat my brain.
They drove me crazy!

Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.

So I sat in the middle of the floor
Surrounded by rats.

Rat? I can't stand rats.
They tickled my feet.
They made me laugh.
I laughed so hard I thought I would die

Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.

Worms? I hate worms.
They burrowed into my skull And started to eat my brain.
They drove me crazy!

Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.

Surrounded by rats.

They tickled my feet.
They made me laugh.
I laughed so hard I thought I would die

Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.

Worms? I hate worms.
They burrowed into my skull And started to eat my brain.
They drove me crazy!

Corner? There was no corner
So I sat in the middle of the floor
Surrounded by rats.

Rat? I can't stand rats.
They tickled my feet.
They made me laugh.
I laughed so hard I thought I would die

Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.

Worms? I hate worms.
They burrowed into my skull And started to eat my brain.
They drove me crazy!

Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.

Worms? I hate worms.
They burrowed into my skull And started to eat my brain.
They drove me crazy!

Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.

Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.

Corner? There was no corner
So I sat in the middle of the floor
Surrounded by rats.

Rat? I can't stand rats.
They tickled my feet.
They made me laugh.
I laughed so hard I thought I would die

Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.
